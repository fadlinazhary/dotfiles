# Aeternaline's Dotfiles (WIP)

This repository contains the dotfiles for my personal Linux setup, which is still a work in progress (WIP). My goal is to create a minimal yet functional environment that suits my needs for daily tasks, programming, and system management. Below is an overview of the current state of my setup.

## Overview

- Base System: Arch Linux
- Window Manager: Hyprland (Wayland compositor)
- Status Bar: Waybar (minimal, customizable Wayland bar)
- Notification Center: SwayNotificationCenter (notification daemon for Wayland)
- Application Launcher: Rofi (application launcher and window switcher)

This setup is constantly evolving, so please be aware that some configurations are incomplete or experimental. Feel free to explore, but know that things may change as I continue refining and improving my environment.
