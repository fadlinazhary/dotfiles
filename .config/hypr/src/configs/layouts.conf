# Hyprland Layout Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
# This file defines the layout behavior for window management
# in Hyprland. You can choose between 'dwindle' and 'master'
# layouts, each offering unique window tiling strategies.
#
# To modularize your configuration, include this file in your
# main configuration with:
# source = ~/.config/hyprland/layouts.conf
#
# For detailed documentation, refer to:
# https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/
# ===========================================================

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Dwindle Layout
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# The 'dwindle' layout organizes windows in a binary tree
# structure, dynamically splitting space based on the
# width-to-height ratio of containers.
#
# More info: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Dwindle-Layout/
# -----------------------------------------------------------
dwindle {
    # Enable pseudotiling to retain floating size when tiled
    pseudotile = true

    # Force split direction: 0 = follow mouse, 1 = always left/top, 2 = always right/bottom
    force_split = 0

    # Preserve split direction regardless of container changes
    preserve_split = true
}

# üçµ‚ú® Master Layout ‚Äì Your Elegant Window Butler ‚ú®üçµ
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
# The 'master' layout designates one or more windows as the
# "master," typically occupying the left side of the screen,
# while other windows (the "slaves") are gracefully tiled
# on the right. This layout ensures that your most important
# window always stays in focus, like a devoted butler attending
# to your needs with grace and precision.
